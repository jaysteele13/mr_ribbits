### What Mr Ribbits can do!
- Basic AutoPilot -> Autonomous Driving
- Face Detection configured -> can hypothetically track faces
- Deploys local webpage to show face detection.
- Plays meme song when he is switched off, (he memes on people)
- isGrounded Feature
- play Tetris theme when not grounded
- SuicidePrevention()
- hes chill

### What to implement:
- Need Level Shifter to allow serial communication between Uno and ESP32, then can employ face tracking.
- More advanced Autopilot... Autopilotv2!
- Easter Egg feature - play hidden song by movement

### Is there lost potential?
1. IS set up to **detect acceleration, current rotation and temperature**, however have disabled this due to the memory cost and lack of innovative ideas to explore these features.
2. By streaming video and a JavaScript-based HTML page over an isolated WiFi connection, it becomes possible to control Mr. Ribbits directly from a computer.
