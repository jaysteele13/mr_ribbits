- Plays meme song when he is switched off, (he memes on people)
- isGrounded Feature

### What to implement:
- Configure Camera
- AI with Camera? If Uno can hack it.
- More advanced Autopilot... Autopilotv2!
- Easter Egg feature - play hidden song by hidden button

### Is there lost potential?
1. IS set up to **detect acceleration, current rotation and temperature**, however have disabled this due to the memory cost and lack of innovative ideas to explore these features.
